## 🎓 How Fantasy Football Teaches Data Analysis

### 1. Player Performance Analysis
Students learn to interpret real-world performance metrics:
- **Points Awarded** - How players earn points based on their match performance
- **Minutes Played** - Understanding player fitness and availability
- **Position Impact** - How different positions score differently
- **Team Form** - Analyzing which teams' players perform better

**Learning Opportunity:**
- Students discuss why certain players earned more points
- Debate whether expensive players are worth the investment
- Analyze trends over the season

### 2. Budget Constraints & Resource Allocation
Students learn financial planning concepts:
- **Fixed Budget** - Each student starts with the same budget (like real businesses)
- **Cost vs. Performance** - Comparing player prices to their expected points
- **Opportunity Cost** - Choosing between expensive stars and value players
- **Portfolio Theory** - Diversifying player selections

**Learning Opportunity:**
- "Should I buy the expensive striker or get 2-3 cheaper players?"
- "Which is better value: a midfielder from a attacking team or a defender?"
- "How do I maximize my remaining budget?"

### 3. Strategic Decision Making
Students develop analytical thinking:
- **Data-Driven Choices** - Making team decisions based on statistics, not emotion
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying which players consistently perform well
- **Risk Assessment** - Predicting which players might get injured or lose form
- **Comparative Analysis** - Ranking players within their position

**Learning Opportunity:**
- Students compare player statistics side-by-side
- Discuss upcoming match difficulty to predict point potential
- Analyze historical performance trends

### 4. Class Discussion & Debate
The platform creates natural discussion points:
- **Pre-Match Analysis** - Discussing which players to select
- **Post-Match Evaluation** - Analyzing why certain players performed
- **Transfer Decisions** - Debating whether to change teams
- **League Standings** - Discussing standings and strategies
